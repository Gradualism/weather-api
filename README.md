# Simple Weather
This shouldn't be too hard. Right?

## Purpose
Mostly a learning project to consume the Open Weather Map API and display some user-selected data.

## Note on API Keys
API keys are stored in a separate configuration file that is not available in this repo. You can always get your own API keys on the Open Weather Map website (at no cost) to use for development. Sorry for the inconvenience!
